Activity: Building a Payment Processing Framework using Delegates
Scenario:
You are tasked with creating a Payment Processing Framework for an e-commerce platform. 
Initially, the platform supports three payment methods: Credit Card, PayPal, and Bank Transfer. 
However, the platform needs to be extensible to allow new payment methods (like Cryptocurrency or Apple Pay) without requiring major changes to the existing framework.

You'll use delegates to enable this flexibility so that new payment methods can be added dynamically.
